Passionate about solving real-world problems through data, analytics, and AI

Right now, I work as a Data Scientist with a focus on business intelligence. My path has always been a blend of tech, analysis, and a real desire to solve meaningful, real-world problems. Iâ€™ve been diving deeper into machine learning and AI, not just to use the tools, but to really understand why and how they work.
