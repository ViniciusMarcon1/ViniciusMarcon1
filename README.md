## About me

Right now, I work as a Data Scientist with a focus on business intelligence. My path has always been a blend of tech, analysis, and a real desire to solve meaningful, real-world problems. I’ve been diving deeper into machine learning and AI, not just to use the tools, but to really understand why and how they work.

My background isn’t just technical — before transitioning into data, I worked as an enterprise account executive. Back then, I was always trying to get to the real root of a client’s problem so I could actually help, not just sell. The deeper I dive into tech, the more I believe I can do that in a much more impactful way — by building better, smarter solutions!

I really value clean, interpretable solutions that focus on what actually matters, rather than overcomplicating things or just scratching the surface. Whether I’m building dashboards or running experiments, I always try to stay grounded in the real questions the business is trying to answer.


## Tech Stack and Tools

Most of my work today involves Python, SQL, and Power BI — but I’m always exploring new tools and frameworks to keep learning and growing.
